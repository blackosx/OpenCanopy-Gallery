Acidanthera media sets provide sample designs on how to create media sets for OpenCanopy. Currently there are three different media sets, which follow the original Apple Boot Picker UI of different macOS generations: 

- Chardonnay (10.9 and older)
- Syrah (since 10.10 till 10.15)
- GoldenGate (11 and newer)

These media sets are the ones OpenCanopy is tested with and are therefore always up-to-date. Currently the resources are maintained by [@Andrey1970](https://github.com/Andrey1970AppleLife).
