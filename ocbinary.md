# Acidanthera Gallery

* [Acidanthera's OcBinaryData Repo](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData)

Acidanthera themes provide sample designs on how to create themes for OpenCanopy. Currently there are three different themes, which follow the original Apple Boot Picker UI of different macOS generations: 

- Old (10.9 and older)
- Default (since 10.10 till 10.15)
- Modern (11 and newer)

These themes are the ones OpenCanopy is tested with and are therefore always up-to-date. Currently the resources are maintained by [@Andrey1970](https://github.com/Andrey1970AppleLife).
